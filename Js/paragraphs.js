    "Last month a grand exhibition was held in our city. My friends and I went to see it in evening.Our first impression on entering the grounds was that whole thing looked like a fairyland. The vast space was decorated in magnificent, bright and purple colour and lit up with countless lights. Men, women and children were moving from corner to corner, admiring the beauty of all kinds of stalls set up. These stalls were like small shops. While the stalls made a very interesting sight, what attracted us most was the Children's Corner in the exhibition. The Children's Corner was crowded with boys and girls. All types of amusements could be seen here. Children and some grown-ups were enjoying the giant wheel, wooden hoses, dodge-cars, railway train and other things. I too had my share of fun with my friends and returned home after enjoying a most delightful evening.",

    "Some people think that the aim of education is merely to give ledge. These people want students to read books, books, books, and do nothing else but add to their knowledge. Others believe that knowledge alone is enough; only that which enables a man to earn his living can be called education. Such people think that bread is more important than-anything else.

And yet they forget many things that were not so pleasant in their childhood. Their is a funny story that tells of a boy who was crying because he had to go back to school after the holidays and the father scolded him and said, \"Why, I only wish I could be a boy and go to school again.\" And all in a moment, the father was a little boy and his son was a grown-up man like his father. And the father, in the shape of a little boy, had to go to school; and I can tell you he did not like it at all. A child's troubles may seem small to grown-ups but they were very big to him.",

    "The Life Insurance Corporation of India settles a large number of Death Claims every year. Only in case of fraudulent suppression of material information is the liability repudiated. This is to ensure that claims are not paid to fraudulent persons at the cost of honest policyholders. The number of Death Claims repudiated is, however, very small. Even in these cases, an opportunity is given to the claimant to make a representation for consideration by the Review Committees of the Zonal office and the Central Office. As a result of such review, depending on the merits of each case, appropriate decisions are taken. The Claims Review Committees of the Central and Zonal Offices have among their Members, a retired High Court/ District Court Judge. This has helped providing transparency and confidence in Corporation operations and has resulted in greater satisfaction among claimants, policyholders and public.",

    "I am going to begin my real life out of the shell of security of my parents. What I know and understand about being a teenager is happiness, parties, friendship and attraction. But, what I am being told is that it is a period of life of rage and serenity. It is the delicate period of my life where I will be shutting between being a pampered child to being an adult of whom a lot is expected. It will be difficult for me to understand the emotional and physical changes. I don't know how I will be able to handle the peer pressure but I will try to face all this with the support of my parents. I hope that it will be a period which I will cherish and enjoy but within the limits, which if crossed then no Rama would come to save me from the clutches of Ravana.",
    "Too much importance must not be attached to the wrong acts done by children, particularly if they happen to be of a minor nature. Many boys and girls at a young age are likely to be in the habit of stealing neglecting their studies, slipping out of their classes, or using bad language. In nearly every case, the root cause of the is the fact that proper care of the child is not taken in the house, or sufficient efficient interest is not shown in him. But if parents were wise, they would correct the faults of their children by paying more attention to them. Whatever the case, one thing should never be done. The bad things in the children should never be compelled to change for the better under fear of the rod. Physical punishment does not improve them. It only makes them worse than before.",
